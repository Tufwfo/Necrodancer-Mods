These are mods I made for a game called Crypt of the Necrodancer for fun and to practice my coding. 

NecroSplit is the culmination of the experience I gained from making the other mods. It adds an automatic speedrun timer to the game.

Amogusbegins is a joke mod that recreates a feature from the game Among Us but it still took quite a lot of work.

Delta2 makes the game speed up slightly every beat until the player dies or wins.

DiscoLights makes enemies only visible while they're standing on a disco floor tile.
